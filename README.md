# CSCE-221
Data Structures

Course Description: Specification and implementation of basic abstract data types and their associated algorithms including stacks, queues, lists, sorting and selection, searching, graphs, and hashing; performance tradeoffs of different implementations and asymptotic analysis of running time and memory usage; includes the execution of student programs written in C++. 

Notes: I've found that the distinction of 'efficient' vs. just 'functional' process design is important to consider for real-world applications as well. Varies per situation however, parameters and limitations can be different than just step count and clock speed. 

Run Info: Run with g++ (and make, where applicable with makefile) via command line.

Usage Note: This repo is for display/reference purposes only. Do not use for your own coursework, cheating/plagirism will not be tolerated. If you are an instructor for this course and want to request that I take this repo down, please open a new Issue indicating such and I will comply promptly.
